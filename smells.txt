1.  This code smell is "Duplicated Code" and the refactoring option we use to fix it is "Extract Method".
2.  Done.
3.  This code smell is "Feature Envy" because it calls methods in another class. 
	The refactoring option we use to fix it is "Move Method"
4.  I eliminated this repeated code by inserting the repetitive code into a for loop. However, this was not enough.
	Thereafter, I created a label as per the hint so I could break from the outer loop instead of the inner one.
5.	Done.
6.	I eliminated the duplicated code in "hudson.scheduler.CronTabTest" by highlighting everything within
	the ceil4 test, extracting a method, and calling that method within the ceil5 test, eradicating redundancy 
	in both tests
